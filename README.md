What Car Am I Going to Buy?
===========================
> # lots of cars, lots of options, hard to make the right choice. 

What is it for?
---------------
When you are shopping for a new car there is always the option of having a spreadsheet or a piece of paper where you can write down the models you want and the offers you found in the market. Although pen and paper are always great friends, and notes apps are always handy, you can't easily see what details each model has. You can't easily add new models and keep track of the max price you want to pay for each model.

Whacambuy helps you with a visual list of the car models that are under your radar. Add new models, remove the ones you don't feel like having anymore.

How to use this app
-------------------
1. Sign up entering a username and a password of your choice
2. Click 'Add new car' and enter the specifics of the models you want to buy
3. Search the web and local auto traders
4. Enter notes regarding your search: too hard to find? Too expensive? Gas-guzzling?
5. Check the details of all the models to compare one by one
6. Found out that the V8 sports you always wanted costs a fortune to maintain? Remove it
